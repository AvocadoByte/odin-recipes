    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I know there are hardcore Italian pizza eaters out there who vow to never
      eat a Hawaiian pizza.
    </p>

    <p>
      And although sweet, juicy pineapple and ham may not be traditional pizza,
      just one time, step outside the box and see what you're missing.
    </p>

    <p>It's good, really good, and quick and easy!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup pizza sauce</li>
      <li>4 small naan breads</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>⅓ cup pineapple tidbits, well drained</li>
      <li>2 slices deli ham, cut into bite-sized pieces /li></li>
      <li>2 slices cooked bacon, crumbled</li>
      <li>1 thin slice red onion, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>

        with foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread pizza sauce on naan breads and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.
        Top with pineapple tidbits, ham, bacon, and red onion. Place on the
        prepared baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown and cheese has
        melted, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
